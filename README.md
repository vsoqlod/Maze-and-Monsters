# Maze-and-Monsters

This program is a text-based game that allows the user to explore a dungeon maze and fight monsters along the way. The goal is to reach the dungeon's exit alive. The program has two versions, one using the singleton pattern and the other using the factory method pattern. The factory method pattern version is an upgraded version of the singleton version, with different levels of enemies as the user progresses through different stages.
